          <img class="ddua" src="css/Images/uarr0.svg">
          <p class="data dataa">The technology behind Bitcoin can be revolutionary as it still has many ways to grow. Bitcoin is starting to become adopted by many companies, with even Goldman Sachs looking into this area. As now up to millions are starting to use it, it seems like the whole world knows it. However, we still can share it with others around us to create a more intelligent environment. The impact within our community has been measurable, with us spreading to some classmates and neighbors. A few of the examples are shown below. My eye for design has improved as well, with designing the brochure and website being particularly beneficial. I also was able to learn some new information about Bitcoin and blockchain, with Daniel introducing me to the topic. Additionally, the discussion with others somewhat improved my communication skills. In the future, I can have a slight leap of these skills while entering the real world. After doing all of this, it has been quite an experience, and I had a pretty good time. I learned that I could probably go into design and that partnership is quite important. And this is why I decided to work on this: to learn more about new tech, practice some of my design skills, and have an exciting time sharing with others. </p>

          <p class="data datab">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of these few months, Bitcoin has been very volatile, going up and down and around. However, through these dips and peaks, one thing has not changed. The technology behind it has not changed. And so I still stand, knowing that this ambition will not go to waste.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our blockchain passion project has addressed and impacted this community in quite a way. The idea was to create a better understanding of what was behind Bitcoin, and not just to have mindless individuals go for a trend in hope of make a few quick bucks. The topic is very relevant to today’s world, for it may be our future currency. Adoption of it is already beginning, and even some governments are behind it now. By creating a better understanding, people would be able to be less ignorant and more creative, showing a new path for some. Many have learned, for we have had over dozens of people receive brochures, others talked to personally by us, and some who have visited our website. A few stories and comments are listed below. In the future, we hope the spread can go global.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this project, we had many difficulties but were able to pull through and finish strong. Many abilities were gained from working on this project, providing a helpful push towards today’s reality. For one, my front end coding skills were practiced and developed, improving my HTML, CSS, Jquery, and JS. I was also able to learn how to incorporate various libraries, like hint.css or Scroll Reveal. Through all the talking, I learned how to communicate better, with a more systematic way of explaining information. Also, my eye for design has increased, learning about new ways to create websites and further improvements I can do. With this new knowledge, I was able to create a better and more interactive website. The pamphlet, the website, and the talking all were fruit from the tree of experience.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blockchain and bitcoin have been fascinating since I ever learned about them. So for the jist of it, we decided to work on it. I was able to teach Ian the main idea, and he was also able to introduce it to others. I had struggling times to fit in all my activities, so time management was a big achievement as well as persevering through bugs and issues. Although we were able to pull this off, I learned that I have much to know and little time to spare. The Passion Project was quite eye-opening, opening a new realm of opportunity.

            <li>"The lesson was informative and intriguing. This information will be very applicable in life, especially since our society is ever-evolving!" - Stephanie</li>
            <li>"It opened a new perspective on these internet currencies!" - Lawerence</li>
            <li>"Bitcoin has the power to revolutionize the industry of cryptocoins and money itself by offering secure transactions and high rewards to the miners." - Brandon</li>
            <li>"In Depth!" - Jason</li>
            <li>"It's Good - Because it's informative" - Aram</li>
            <li>"The anonymity of cryptocurriences is a very valuable perk to have, but because you can send any amount of bitcoin to any person it can spark many speculation from the government if its safe or not. If it overcomes the phenomenon and takes over the dollar, then you will expect the government to create databases for bitcoin exchanges." - Syed</li>
            <li>"The website was very interesting to read. It really shows what is happening in the world; especially how it’s evolving." - Kyra</li>
