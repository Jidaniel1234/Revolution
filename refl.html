          <p class="data dataa">What the jiminy crickets did you just flaming say about me, you little bozo? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Cub Scouts, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret camping trips in Wyoming, and I have over 300 confirmed knots. I am trained in first aid and I’m the top bandager in the entire US Boy Scouts (of America). You are nothing to me but just another friendly face. I will clean your wounds for you with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this annual trip, mark my words. You think you can get away with saying those shenanigans to me over the Internet? Think again, finkle. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of MSN friends across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the seminars, man. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your bake sale. You’re frigging done, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can tie knots in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in road safety, but I have access to the entire manual of the United States Boy Scouts (of America) and I will use it to its full extent to train your miserable butt on the facts of the continents, you little schmuck. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your silly tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goshdarned sillyhead. I will throw leaves all over you and you will dance in them. You’re friggin done, kiddo.</p>

          <p class="data datab">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of these few months, Bitcoin has been very volatile, going up and down and around. However, through these dips and peaks, one thing has not changed. The technology behind it has not changed. And so I still stand, knowing that this ambition will not go to waste.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our blockchain passion project has addressed and impacted this community in quite a way. The idea was to create a better understanding of what was behind Bitcoin, and not just to have mindless individuals go for a trend in hope of make a few quick bucks. The topic is very relevant to today’s world, for it may be our future currency. Adoption of it is already beginning, and even some governments are behind it now. By creating a better understanding, people would be able to be less ignorant and more creative, showing a new path for some. Many have learned, for we have had over dozens of people receive brochures, others talked to personally by us, and some who have visited our website. A few stories and comments are listed below. In the future, we hope the spread can go global.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this project, we had many difficulties but were able to pull through and finish strong. Many abilities were gained from working on this project, providing a helpful push towards today’s reality. For one, my front end coding skills were practiced and developed, improving my HTML, CSS, Jquery, and JS. I was also able to learn how to incorporate various libraries, like hint.css or Scroll Reveal. Through all the talking, I learned how to communicate better, with a more systematic way of explaining information. Also, my eye for design has increased, learning about new ways to create websites and further improvements I can do. With this new knowledge, I was able to create a better and more interactive website. The pamphlet, the website, and the talking all were fruit from the tree of experience.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blockchain and bitcoin have been fascinating since I ever learned about them. So for the jist of it, we decided to work on it. I was able to teach Ian the main idea, and he was also able to introduce it to others. I had struggling times to fit in all my activities, so time management was a big achievement as well as persevering through bugs and issues. Although we were able to pull this off, I learned that I have much to know and little time to spare. The Passion Project was quite eye-opening, opening a new realm of opportunity.
