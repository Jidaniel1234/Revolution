    <p class="info">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HAH. Amateur. I've organically grown a fake identity over the last fifteen years and have used it to start a small carrier pigeon company in the third world. I type out my messages on a typewriter in a lead box buried thirty feet underground, then have mute eunuchs translate the text into French sign language. This is then videotaped with a time delay, and the VHS tapes are sent to several different locations around the globe in plain unmarked post. Once they arrive, they are viewed by a select group of people with anterograde amnesia and translated into Morse code. These Morse code snippets are then placed in glass bottles and dumped into a secret gulf current I have discovered, where eventually they relay themselves to one of three stations. There, they are loaded onto the carrier pigeons and sent to Bill Gates personally, where he has the latest Artificial Intelligence scan the messages in case they were compromised. If everything is good, the A.I. sends the messages, encrypted with quantum bypass protocols, straight to your mom's house.</p>

    <p class="info">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a teenager from Southern California, Daniel strives to learn more about new things, everywhere and everyday. He particularly likes to code, hangout with friends, and play basketball. Proficient in front end languages while learning new software programming languages like Java and Python, he hope to get into the tech revolution beholding his generation. Learning about bitcoin and its wonders, he has decided to co-found a small awareness system for the ins and outs of decentralization. In the future, Daniel would be very excited to work in these fields! </p>
